# Train-Activity

This is my seventh homework assignment for my coding bootcamp class and focuses on the use of firebase.

## How to use the page:

* When adding trains, administrators will submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes

* The app will calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

* Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.

## Have fun on the page
